# Industrial Data Science Inc. 

Industrial Data Science focuses on solving data science problems in natural resources industries, namely, the oil and gas, 
mining, and environemntal industries. We offer the following services:

- **Teaching and Technical Mentorship**: 
- **Data Science**: Natural Resources Industry focused data science, data modelling, and machine learning. 
- **Geomodeling**: Geomodels of any complexity in almost any software, including Petrel, GoCad, GSLIB.
- **Fluid Flow Simulation**: Fluids modelling and the flow of fluids in porous media in Eclipse

# Why 

Industrial and natural resources data is bound by the laws of physics and chemistry. The collected data is limited by the 
instruments used to sample and collect data. Machine learning tools and AI dont know these limits. They have to be knitted into 
the solution stitch by stich. Practitioners not raised in the oil and gas, mining, and environmental industries build models 
and solutions that dont honor industrial quirks or science. 

At Industrial Data Science we built our tradcraft in the field. We build models that have context and utility. We build 
tools and models that are easy to use, offer real world utility, and give our clients competitive advantage.
