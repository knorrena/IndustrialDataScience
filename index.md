# Industrial Data Science Inc.

Industrial Data Science constructs data science solutions for engineering data in industrial settings. We practice in oil and gas, environmental, and mining industries.

We have hands on experience as geoscientists, reservoir engineers, hydrogeoscientists, and mining engineers before mastering data science. Evolution toward data science is important. At Industrial Data Science we understand the context of the data, how data features interact, why features do or do not interact, and what plausible outcomes are. Context awareness helps us prepare solutions that have tangible return on investment and helps make our clients look like rockstars.

We offer a range of products. Hera are some examples:

1. A predictive algorithms for predicting 90 day initial production 

1. Integrated geological and reservoir model Selected and drilled well locations on a 49 year old asset in Egypt’s Western Desert that increased field production by 117%, increased OOIP by 122%, and increased recovery factor by 103%, increased reserves by 125%. Prepared reserves and managed reserves auditors. Economic modelling. 
2. Devised an experimental design driven $127MM development program for the first multi-well horizontal multi-frac exploitation program in Egypt. The program was custom built to motivate the signing of a revised production sharing contract to significantly increase corporate revenue.
3. Used machine learning driven advanced PVT, relative permeability models, and log-to-water saturation algorithms to increased OOIP by 120% and increased RF by 102%.
4. Increased uptime by 80% on 9 wells by applying data science tools to discover a root cause behind rotor shearing issues. Analyzed VFD/PCP pump data to engineer an operations program to prevent rotor shearing and increase reserves and reduce production variability. 
5. Engineered and managed a $27MM vertically integrated cogeneration-exploitation plan from concept and economic model, to final product. A liquids-rich (40-70bbls/mmcf) formation shipped all produced fluids without accounting for liquids. Built program for a chiller to separate out liquids. Drilled new wells to simultaneously meet nominations and supply fuel gas to the Balzac cogeneration facility. Eliminated aspects of the gathering system. 
▪	Applied Data Science and Geospatial tools for competitor analysis to increase production by 140%. Interrogated internal data, drilling applications, frac database, and competitor annual reports and news briefs to build and calibrate models of well performance.  Leveraged the data to revise the drilling program and devise a competitive frac program.
▪	Built and sold a fast single cell SAGD flow simulator based on theoretical principles to evaluate minimum maintenance injection rate and steam quality to sustain minimum productivity.
▪	Built a bespoke economic modelling engine that appropriately copes with production uncertainty and accounts for all financial requirements and best practices. The engine was required use for years by Canadian business units in Nexen.  
▪	Developed and published a novel SAGD well-pair landing depth algorithm that included a static proxy for fluid and steam flow.
▪	As Head of Geosciences, recruited and managed GGREs, mentored and trained colleagues, and lead the team to a 20% increase production in 8 months using reservoir modelling.  
▪	Lead the geologic uncertainty modeling effort for the world’s deepest exploration well ($156MM, Knottyhead, Gulf of Mexico).
▪	Managed the design and delivery of the first mobile fluids testing lab in Chad Africa. 
▪	Lead reserves estimator for acquisition opportunities on projects valued up to $780MM. 
▪	Reservoir engineering expert in multiple international and national partnerships for assets in Canada, Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria, and Chad with Total, Chevron, Hess, Exxon and others.

Data Science
▪	Designed, managed, and delivered a LGR IP90 prediction tool for TAQA and PWC. The project to identified drilling and completion practices that maximize probability of success on an unconventional asset. Over 1000 wells, and 150 features. Constructed data model, and after the Gradient Boost based model interrogation, the effective feature set contained 16 essential features. Used an interactive Jupyter Notebooks as a deliverable for development planning.  
▪	Built hydrogeologic models for oilsands tailing ponds and constructed contaminant plume models. 
▪	Invented and sold custom algorithms that detected and classified anomalous streaming Distributed Control System (DCS) transmitter signals and prevented plant shutdowns using algorithms included KNN, gradient boost, logistic regression, LDA, QDA, AI (keras/tensorflow). 
▪	Processed SCADA streaming data from variable frequency drive PCP pumps on a water flood project to provide water cut and power consumption using AI (Keras). 
▪	Built and sold an AWS cloud-based pipeline risk assessment and business development tool for identifying and classifying clients that risked missing production volumes, or pipeline assets by produced corrosive fluids. Python and SKLearn were used to write all the backend computational components, and Java for the front end and rendering components. 
▪	Directed the construction of a cloud-based Azure data repository for multiple clients.
▪	Built the finance and operations model to gain $63MM of support to purchase a cogeneration facility.


Our clients include CNRL, TAQA, Transglobe Energy, Pembina Pipeline, PWC, The Northerm Miner, Imperial Oil, and Suncor.
