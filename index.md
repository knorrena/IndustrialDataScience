# Industrial Data Science Inc. 

Industrial Data Science Inc. focuses on solving data science problems in the Geosciences. We offer the following services:

- **Data Science**: Natural Resources Industry focused data science, data modelling, and machine learning. 
- **Geomodeling**: Geomodels of any complexity in almost any software, including Petrel, GoCad, GSLIB.
- **Fluid Flow Simulation**: Fluids modelling and the flow of fluids in porous media in Eclipse 
- **Teaching and Thought Leadership**: Programming and data science skills for the natural resources industry, geomodelling, 
and flow simulation.  

See the [Teaching Section](https://knorrena.github.io/IndustrialDataScience/content/2-Teaching.html) for a collection of 
Jupyter notebooks on Python and Data Science in the Natural Resources Industries.  
See the [Projects Section](https://knorrena.github.io/IndustrialDataScience/content/1-Projects.html) to review a sample of 
the projects that Industrial Data Science Inc. have completed.  

## Putting Data Science into GeoScience 

My passion is helping people and corporations use data to create enduring value with real return on investment. 
In the first two thirds of my career I used reservoir modeling to highlight premium opportunities and showcase 
development plans that made the most of an asset.

I started using machine learning and artificial intelligence to make better decisions in light of the 
abundant and often unused data collected in the oil and gas industry. While on that path I discovered a lot of 
challenges in the space between geosciences and IT: each discipline speaks very different languages and have very 
different business directives. Establishing congruency did not come easily.  

Over multiple projects, I have shown that data science can generate as much corporate value as the geosciences 
and I believe that data science principles should be core skills for geoscientists, and this is the root of my passion: 
to build geoscience data literacy and a data culture the generates more value today than the day before.

## What We Can Do For You

Some examples:

1. Interrogate data historian. Find problematic process trains. Identify ESG opportunities. Use machine learning 
to model opportunites. Quantify the distribution of return on investment.  

2. Design and build a geosciences and production data model that provides unfettered and consistent data for the geosciences, 
production accounting, and finance team use.

3. Teach integrated geologic and flow simulation modelling workflow, including variogram modelling, facies modelling 
and indicator simulation, sequential Gaussian simulation and permeability modelling, robust water saturation modelling and 
consistent relative permeability modelling.
