Industrial Data Science Inc. 

Industrial Data Science focuses on solving data science problems in natural resources industries, namely, the oil and gas, 
mining, and environemntal industries. The data science problems in the natural resources industries have common interactive 
features:

- ** Spatial Data **: Natural resources data are distributed in space. Where GIS data is multilayered and 2D, natural resources is 
multilayered and in 3D. In the oil and gas industry, porosity and permeability control
storage and deliverability, and vary in space according the deposition environment. In the mining, ore grade varies in space according
geologic processes, and in hydrogeology, contaminant plumes are driven by gravity, and percolation through geolologic media. 

- ** Temporal Data **: 


- Sensor data from processing and chemical facilities.

I have over 20 years of experience in industrial  as geoscientist, reservoir engineer, hydrogeoscientist, and a mining engineer before mastering data science. I evolved Evolution toward data science is important. At Industrial Data Science we understand the context of the data, how data features interact, why features do or do not interact, and what plausible outcomes are. Context awareness helps us prepare solutions that have tangible return on investment and helps make our clients look like rockstars.
