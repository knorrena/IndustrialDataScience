# Industrial Data Science Inc. 

Industrial Data Science Inc. focuses on solving data science problems in natural resources industries, namely, the oil and gas, 
mining, and environmental industries. We offer the following services:

- **Data Science**: Natural Resources Industry focused data science, data modelling, and machine learning. 
- **Geomodeling**: Geomodels of any complexity in almost any software, including Petrel, GoCad, GSLIB.
- **Fluid Flow Simulation**: Fluids modelling and the flow of fluids in porous media in Eclipse 
- **Teaching and Thought Leadership**: Programming and data science skills for the natural resources industry, geomodelling, 
and flow simulation.  

See the [Teaching Section] (https://knorrena.github.io/IndustrialDataScience/content/2-Teaching.html) for a collection of 
Jupyter notebooks on Python and Data Science in the Natural Resources Industries.  
See the [Projects Section](https://knorrena.github.io/IndustrialDataScience/content/1-Projects.html) to review a sample of 
the projects that Industrial Data Science Inc. have completed.  

## Putting Science into Data Science 

Industrial and natural resources data is bound by the laws of physics and chemistry. The collected data is limited by the 
instruments used to sample and collect data. Machine learning tools and AI dont know these limits. They have to be knitted into 
the solution stitch by stich. Practitioners not raised in the oil and gas, mining, and environmental industries build models 
and solutions that dont honor industrial quirks or science. 

At Industrial Data Science we built our tradecraft in the field. We build models that have context and utility. We build 
tools and models that are easy to use, offer real world utility, and give our clients competitive advantage.

## What We Can Do For You

Some examples:

1. Interrogate data historian. Find problematic process trains. Identify ESG opportunities. Use machine learning 
to model opportunites. Quantify the distribution of return on investment.  

2. Design and build a geosciences and production data model that provides unfettered and consistent data for the geosciences, 
production accounting, and finance team use.

3. Teach integrated geologic and flow simulation modelling workflow, including variogram modelling, facies modelling 
and indicator simulation, sequential Gaussian simulation and permeability modelling, robust water saturation modelling and 
consistent relative permeability modelling.
