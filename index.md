# Industrial Data Science Inc. 

Industrial Data Science focuses on solving data science problems in natural resources industries, namely, the oil and gas, 
mining, and environemntal industries. The data science problems in the natural resources industries have common interactive 
features:

- ** Spatial Data ** : Natural resources data are distributed in space. Where GIS data is multilayered and 2D, natural resources is 
multilayered and in 3D. In the oil and gas industry, the two key features the control hydrocarbon storage and deliverability are porosity and 
permeability, and porosity and permeability vary in space. In the mining, ore grade varies in space according
geologic processes, and in hydrogeology, contaminant plumes are driven by gravity, and percolation through geolologic media, which varies 
in space. 

- ** Time Series Data **: Geologic data are static in that it does not change relative to the period of time we study it. What does change 
are spatial distribution of fluids, and this data is called dynamic data. In hydrogeology, contiminant plumes percolate through porous 
media and contaminant concentration varies in time and space. In oil and gas, there are three different fluids that are studied: oil, 
water, and gas, water being the most important in some cases. Mining is also has time series data. Ore grade, hardness, and mass all 
vary in time.

At Industrial Data Science Inc., we have over 25 years of experience working with static and dynamic data in the natural resources 
industry, and we specifically practice geomodelling and data science only in this domain. Our clients include CNRL, TAQA, 
Transglobe Energy, Pembina Pipeline, PWC, The Daily Oil Bulletin, The Northerm Miner, Mining Intelligence, Imperial Oil, and Suncor. 
We are located in Calgary Alberta, Canada, and were established in 2015.
