# Industrial Data Science Inc.

Industrial Data Science constructs data science solutions for engineering data in industrial settings. We practice in oil and gas, environmental, and mining industries.

We have hands on experience as geoscientists, reservoir engineers, hydrogeoscientists, and mining engineers before mastering data science. Evolution toward data science is important. At Industrial Data Science we understand the context of the data, how data features interact, why features do or do not interact, and what plausible outcomes are. Context awareness helps us prepare solutions that have tangible return on investment and helps make our clients look like rockstars.
