    "This session we'll focus on developing core programming skills in Python. Control statements are ubiquitous across all programming languages. For example, previously we plotted a simple map of well locations. The map isnt very informative in that it just posts the surface locations. It would be helpful if we could filter the locations by well type and show only producing locations, or perhaps color the locations by formation. As we progress into more sophisticated data science and machine learnign topics we will also need to know how to perform repeated calculations or manipulations over a loop.\n",
