## Thought Leadership and Data Product Invention, Planning, and Deployment
Clients: Northern Miner, Mining Intelligence, CostMine
Objective: Combine CostMine and Mining Intelligence data, invent new products, and migrate the products and users to a cloud based solution 
The Northern Miner started publication in 1915, and every week it publishes mining industry news, and data insights. The scope of the data includes 


## 90 Days Cumulative Gas to Liquids Ratio Production Forecaster 
Clients: Price Waterhouse and TAQA
Designed, managed, and delivered a LGR IP90 prediction tool for TAQA and PWC. The project to identified drilling and completion practices that maximize probability of success on an unconventional asset. Over 1000 wells, and 150 features. Constructed data model, and after the Gradient Boost based model interrogation, the effective feature set contained 16 essential features. Used an interactive Jupyter Notebooks as a deliverable for development planning.

nitial The Variable Frequency Drive Project
First Project

▪	Designed, managed, and delivered a LGR IP90 prediction tool for TAQA and PWC. The project to identified drilling and completion practices that maximize probability of success on an unconventional asset. Over 1000 wells, and 150 features. Constructed data model, and after the Gradient Boost based model interrogation, the effective feature set contained 16 essential features. Used an interactive Jupyter Notebooks as a deliverable for development planning.  
▪	Built hydrogeologic models for oilsands tailing ponds and constructed contaminant plume models. 
▪	Invented and sold custom algorithms that detected and classified anomalous streaming Distributed Control System (DCS) transmitter signals and prevented plant shutdowns using algorithms included KNN, gradient boost, logistic regression, LDA, QDA, AI (keras/tensorflow). 
▪	Processed SCADA streaming data from variable frequency drive PCP pumps on a water flood project to provide water cut and power consumption using AI (Keras). 
▪	Built and sold an AWS cloud-based pipeline risk assessment and business development tool for identifying and classifying clients that risked missing production volumes, or pipeline assets by produced corrosive fluids. Python and SKLearn were used to write all the backend computational components, and Java for the front end and rendering components. 
▪	Directed the construction of a cloud-based Azure data repository for multiple clients.
▪	Built the finance and operations model to gain $63MM of support to purchase a cogeneration facility.
