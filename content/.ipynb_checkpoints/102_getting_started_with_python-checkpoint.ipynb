    "# A Gentle Introduction to Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Pandas\n",
    "Pandas is an importable Python package with a data platform and an enourmous number of useful subroutines built in, and it has its own syntax. Pandas is easily the most used package in Python. If you installed the Anaconda data science platform then the pandas does not need to be installed as it already is. To use it, it must be imported, and recall that it is imported like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we can import and assign an alias in one line like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is supposed to mean a panel of data. Pandas is as to a spreadsheet as one can get under Python, but its much more powerful and complicated than a spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of use of Pandas is enormous and can cover many hours and many hundreds of lines of text if we dedicated ourselves solely toward learning about Pandas. I dont see much utility in that. I think Pandas has to be absorbed in small doses, and this is the first dose. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas Series and DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two building blocks in Pandas, the series, and the dataframe. In Pandas a column of data is called a series.a collection of one or more series is called a dataframe. A series can be only one data type, an integer, a float, a logical True or False, a datetime, a timedelta, a string, or a category. It is not possible to have a column in a dataframe with more than one data type, but each column can be any data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "On first examination a series looks like a simple list of values, see below."
