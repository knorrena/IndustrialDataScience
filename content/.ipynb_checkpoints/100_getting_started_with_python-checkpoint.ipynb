    "There are alot of commercial softwares available for managing large data volumes and creating visualizations, but they all have limitations that Python gets around. For example, excel is limited to 1.5 million rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are countless beginner guides for starting with Python, what to download, and how write a \"Hello World\" script. So why write another one? I hope that the approach I take is different. I take a projects approach to teaching Python, and I explain every step, the why, the what, and the how. I hope you enjoy it, and most importantly, I hope that I can help you expand your geosciences and engineering skills, and increase your marketability. \n",
    "\n",
    "I use MS Windows. I dont know how to use a Mac, so all the entries and cookbooks will be from a Windows perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, almost all of the cookbooks are written in Markdown language and hosted on GitHUb and there are limitiations. Markdown is a very low level minimalistic language. Pictures are difficult to post and there is no way to get fancy. THis is good. It means we wont have many distractions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a scripting language. Programming languages like Fortran, C++, and C# have to be compiled into an executable program before they can be used. Python is interpreted, not compiled. \n",

    "# Getting Started With Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming hasn't really changed much over the years. To program you still have to write code and execute it. What has changed is how to write and execute code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The leading Python programming environment is Anaconda, and we will be using it in all our work. Anaconda make money by selling licenses to various versions and support for Python. The free version is the Individual version. It has all the same functionality of the other versions, but no support. Download the individual from [here]((https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and install it. Anaconda Individual is big, and it takes a while to download. \n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Anaconda you will have access to a new folder under the Windows button called Anaconda 3 (64-bit) , or Anaconda 3 (32-bit) depending on which version of Windows is on your computer. Inside that folder are the following programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anaconda Navigator: According to Anaconda, Anaconda Navigator is a desktop GUI that comes with Anaconda Individual Edition. It makes it easy to launch applications and manage packages and environments without using command-line commands. We will use it occasionally to install Python packages that make performing certain tasks easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anaconda PowerShell Prompt: The PowerShell prompt gives command line prompt access to Python under Windows PowerShell. I dont understand how PowerShell is different than any other command line prompt window. I have never use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Anaconda Prompt: The Anaconda Prompt gives command line prompt access to Python. I use Anaconda Prompt to install Python packages that are not available through Anaconda Navigator. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook: Jupyter Notebooks are a very powerful way to build and run Python code. This Cookbook is written as a Jupyter Notebook. What makes Jupyter Notebooks so powerful is that they are launched under a web browser and it is possble to create interactive notebooks that can be saved as a website and shared. Jupyter Notebooks can be more difficult to write scripts because there are very limited tools for finding errors and debugging. Clicking the Jupyter Notebook app opens a command line prompt that manages how the Jupyter Notebook is managed in your web browser, that in turn automatically opens your web browser. If you close the command line prompt, the Jupyter Notebook will stop functioning on your browser. We will cover more detailed steps later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spyder: Spyder is a Python developer environment. Spyder is a standalone app for writing Python scripts. It is an excellent tool for writing code, debugging code, but it does not generate interactive graphics. We will occasionally use Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# A First Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the start button, then click on the Jupyter Notebook app. A command line window will open, then your web browser. The new tab the command line prompt opens is a file browser. It allows you to access existing notebooks (file extension of a notebook is .ipynb), or create a new Python Script. \n",
    "\n",
    "Start a new Python script by selecting the drop down menu in the top right hand corner labelled New. Select Notebook: Python 3. A new web browser tab will open up that looks like this:"
